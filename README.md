PEB

software to calculate the bit probability error for transmission network. Developed for the curse of Signals processing I at the university of Antioquia.

## Run the application

Execute the program in a terminal with the following command:

```
python peb.py
```

## Usage

1. Especify the number of links in the communication network. 
2. Add the parameters for the numerator and denominator for the probability error function.
3. Save the initial parameters.
4. Add the link attenuation, voltage an noise error for each link between the two towers.
5. Repeat the previous step for each link the network.
6. Calculate the bit probability error.
